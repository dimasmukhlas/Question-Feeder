# Question-Feeder

This is a special question feeder that uses tabletop.js to serve data to the Brainly answer operations campaigns.

#How to Use the Feed?

Prepare the parent feed by creating a list of questions that you want to serve to the user. I suggest you use data given by Google Analytics add on for spreadsheets and schedule them to be refreshed regualry.

Once you prepared the parent feed, create a separate feed per subject by using the `importrange` formula. I will be sending you a template of this if you need more help.

Make sure you share the spreadsheet publicly, and publish it as well. *This is important*.

Along with the template, I will also share to you a sheet of translations, and copy changes. Please accomplish it ASAP.

Once the page is finished, please install the *File Manager* add-on, and transfer the file there.
